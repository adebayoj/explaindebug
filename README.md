# Debugging Tests for Model Explainations
=====================

This repo contains information to replicate the results from the paper: "Debugging Tests for Model Explanations". 

Each portion of the work is self-contained since we test various methods against different contamination bugs. 


## User Study
=====================

See the [readme](https://github.com/adebayoj/explaindebug/blob/main/userstudy/README.md) in the user study section task details and how to replicate the data set and models used for the study. 

A copy of the first 25 pages of user study is provided in the [top level doc folder](https://github.com/adebayoj/explaindebug/blob/main/doc/end_to_end_survey-1-25.pdf).
